In addition to my work as an Azure Network Support Engineer, I am also an avid enthusiast of networking, homelabbing, and building. 

In my free time, I love exploring the latest technologies and trends in the field, and sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. I am particularly passionate about building and maintaining my own homelab, where I can experiment with new technologies and develop my skills. 

I also enjoy 3D printing and using technology to tackle home projects and improvements. Whether it's gaming on the latest consoles, building a new computer, or learning about the latest developments in cloud computing, I am always eager to explore and learn more. 

I hope that my page will be a place where others can share in my passions and interests, and find inspiration and guidance on their own journey. 

Thanks for stopping by!
