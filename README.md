- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmoseley
- 👀 I’m interested in homelab, home renovations, riding motorcycle, and always learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my CCNA and working at getting registered for classes at DSU for my BS in Cyber Operations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I'm always looking to grow and learn new things. If you see something in my GitHub that you want to use or have modified, let me know :).
